[ Documentation and housekeeping ]

- Put author and version in tombstone comment?
- Documentation
- Add new commands to command_doc


[ Urgent fixes ]

- Ping timeout handler (for us, not other people's timeouts..) (hint: check for var connected = True / make else: connected = False on ping func)
- We also need to handle getting kicked/banned from a server/channel
- Fix the printing of smilies to the console (has to do with strip(":"))
- Make a way to hide prog info (!bot_info from BasicCmds)
- Auto join channels are not added to the list of channels the bot is currently in
  + For example, if the bot automatically joins #general on connect (as set by the server), this won't be added to the bot channels list
- !leave without parameters not working correctly


[ Small fixes and additions ]

- Background color for text (+ add to documentation on text formatting)
- Print "Unknown command." to the console when a command is not recognised?


[ print_data.py ]

- Handler for printing /NAMES list on join (and maybe make a command too?)


[ New commands ]

- !me command (ACTION)
- !who command
    + Who
    + Retrieves information about users (src: http://deoxy.org/chat/unreal.htm)
    + Check src above for more commands to make.
- !flip command (flip a coin) :D
- !stats
	+ more stats cmds
- !roll command (improved !dice, see below at end of file)
- !joke command
- Rename !msg to !chat/!say ? 
- !sendcmd or !action or !me ? (I prefer !sendcmd so we can change nick etc, but maybe !me too?)
- Current action: Making a sandwich, gaming, etc...
- Show current !topic command
- Change topic command if op

- Put !dice, !roll, !flip, etc into game_commands() ? + !help game ?
- !memo command. Example scenario:
  + User: !memo AnotherUser parties disband after combat, so that's probably what happened
  + Bot: Alright, I'll let AnotherUser know.
  + Sends memo as a private message to user.
  + If user is offline, private message will be delivered to them when they comes online.
- !seen command. Example scenario:
  + User1: @seen User2
  + Bot: (User1) User2 was last seen 1 hour, 42 minutes ago saying: the last message I typed was this
  + User3: @seen Bot
  + Bot: (User3) You need to get your eyes checked.
  + User4: @seen User4
  + Bot: (User4) Have you looked in a mirror lately?
  + Achieved by searching logfile?
  + Will have to check if logging is enabled


[ New features ]

- Create config file
- Make !quit accept a quit reason
- Chat reply handler / AI
- Timezone converter
- Google translate?
- Fetch details from link (e.g. if it's a Youtube link, fetch vid title, same for Wikipedia, etc)
- Weather
- Google search top results
- Log errors (maybe bot_errors.txt ?)
- Point system for nick (for games and such)


[ Bot AI ]

- Make it reply to greetings to itself (e.g. "Hey Zoey") (and other messages to itself perhaps?)
- Make greetings random based on list of strings
- Maybe make it say random strings (that'll be in the file) everytime name is mentioned?
- "How are you" replies
- "likewise... I am heading to bed, goodnight all" << make it recognise the goodnight all string there
- Message reply to "I'm back" or "back", etc.?


[ For later ]

- Improve Nickserv handler

- Make settings array?
    + Let user configure bot from file?
- Improve Start screen and/or add UI (like menu with opts)
- Chat response handler cont.

- Vote command
- Make join_chan() check if channel var is valid
- Work on the NickServ handler
- Add data validation, etc.
- Improve commands by displaying helpful syntax/usage messages when what they type does not match params requirement, etc.

- BotClient.disconnect()
- BotClient.change_server()


[ !roll command: (improved !dice) ]

- Example scenario:
  + Shu: !roll 1d6
  + Bot: Shu rolled 1d6: 6  <Total: 6>
  + User2: !roll 10d10
  + Bot: weth rolled 10d10: 5 4 9 9 5 10 9 4 5 5  <Total: 65>
  + User2: !roll 2d6+2
  + Bot: weth rolled 2d6: 5 4  <Total: 9(+2) = 11>
- Possible D&D dice command ideas from an IRC room:
  + Is it possible to make a bot for a virtual tabletop? like virtual DM in D&D?
  + The XdY type of dices
  + you could also set XdY+Z for magic items, Z be 1,2 or 3 depending on the enchantment level..
  + the battle maths would be done automatically
  + the bot could hold player sheets with stats that could be displayed by PMing a certain command to the bot
  + and update them according to the game's progress
  + that would divide a casual D&D dungeon master into a story teller and a DM math bot
  + which could ease up the rules quite a bit
